# Regular-expression-in-Python
In this notebook, I firstly introduced some basic syntax and functions (match, search, sub) of "re" module in Python for regular expressions operations. 

Then I used "mock_data.csv" which contains the information like birthday, phone, names, email, to practice Regex in Python. 

There are four tasks to complete. And I provided multiple solutions for each task.
* Transform the birthday column from European to US data format.  
* Strip everything but the email column.  
* Convert the format to be "name[TAB]birthday", and strip the rest.  
* Strip everything but the lat_long column. Convert it to be "long[TAB]lat".
