# Regular-expression-in-Python
In this notebook, I firstly introduced some basic syntax and functions (match, search, sub) of "re" module in Python for regular expressions operations. 

Then I used "mock_data.csv" which contains the information like birthday, phone, names, email, to practice Regex in Python. 

There are four tasks to complete. And I provided multiple solutions for each task.
